                                On a mission to be the best game dev generalist I can possibly be,
                                serving others best I can.

                                This site exists to update people that are waiting on me to finish these projects,
                                and to keep myself accountable.

                                Currently <u>extremely busy.</u> Will hopefully update this site daily.

                                <p>
                                        Basically just started crunching this out for the community.
                                        Really hoping to have a decent minimum-viable product by July 20th.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        It's all planned out - in fact, the idea has been around for a while.
                                        The foundation for this mod is <u>very</u> sturdy, in theory.
                                        I'm fairly confident.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        As of now, there's a lot of code to sift through. If I'm lucky, everything
                                        should be pretty doable.
                                </p>

                                <p>Research has been done, but there are a few cleanup and data processing tasks to be
                                        completed.</p>
