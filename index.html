                                <h3>Summary of Projects</h3>
                                <p>
                                        As of right now, I'm working on several Archipelago randomizer projects.
                                        The others are side projects.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        The Minecraft and Sonic CD randomizer projects are very different in most ways,
                                        but similar in others.
                                        They both involve adding client support on top of a scripting language,
                                        the former which I've used much more than the latter.
                                        So my hope is that by completing one project, the other will be easier, and vice
                                        versa.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        The CrossCode randomizer is a different can of worms, since
                                        I mostly work on the data used for generation - however,
                                        it'd be cool to take on more roles once these other randomizers
                                        are in a good state.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        My other projects are more experimental. I'm interested in developing them
                                        for other reasons. They are not as high priority at the moment.

                                <h3>AP Minecraft Multiworld Randomizer</h3>
                                <p>
                                        The unofficial KubeJS implementation is joining forces
                                        with the upstream implementation for further modpack support.
                                        This is great news, and if all goes well,
                                        this could bring more modded Minecraft support to the wider community.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        Somehow, we're going to have to architect the underlying implementation
                                        to work for everyone - from casual players to modded veterans - while
                                        making it relatively easy for modpack devs to get involved.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        The other limitation is that,
                                        instead of a thin wrapper around Kube working with
                                        a manual modpack installation,
                                        we should do our best to support the original randomizer's
                                        support for headless server hosting.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        Still though, as ambitious as the plan is, we're working to fill in the blanks;
                                        it already feels like everyone's on the same page, for the most part.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        As I learn more about the Archipelago API,
                                        I will likely be working on this randomizer in tandem with
                                        the Sonic CD randomizer, so I can have a bit of room to fail there too.
                                        This project has more moving parts, after all.

                                        Right now I'm working on extracting and representing
                                        data for a new tradesanity feature.

                                        Archipelago with some of my other randomizer projects,
                                        so that I might contribute in other ways outside of data analysis as well.
