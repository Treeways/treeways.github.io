                                <p>
                                        As of right now, I'm working on several Archipelago randomizer projects.
                                        The others are side projects.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        The CrossCode randomizer is a different can of worms, since
                                        I mostly work on the data used for generation - however,
                                        it'd be cool to take on more roles once these other randomizers
                                        are in a good state.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        My other projects are more experimental. I'm interested in developing them
                                        for other reasons. They are not as high priority at the moment.

                                <h3>AP Minecraft Multiworld Randomizer</h3>
                                <p>
                                        A full client rewrite is being worked on. It's focused on
                                        modularity, maintainability and flexibility for any kind of modpack.
                                        This will include first-class vanilla support
                                        for the latest version of Minecraft
                                        (possibly including individual mod implementations),
                                        KubeJS support for various versions,
                                        and core client code that is easy enough to port
                                        to beta and legacy versions of Minecraft.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        I'm putting in my all to offer the best I can. If all goes well,
                                        this could bring wide support to modded Minecraft randomization
                                        for the broader community.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        We'll be making the vanilla implementation work for everyone,
                                        from casual players to modded veterans.
                                        We plan to bring full feature parity from the old randomizer to the new one,
                                        and create a very sturdy foundation for adding new features on top of it.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Technical Details (Thus Far)</h4>
                                <p>This is starting to get very ambitious.</p>
                                <p>There are many features that should exist, all differing in scale:</p>
                                <ol>
                                        <li>An APWorld template designed for flexibility when writing logic</li>
                                        <li>Headless server instance management from the APWorld</li>
                                        <li>Optional support for running the randomizer within a single Prism client instance</li>
                                        <li>A datapack generation system for "patching in" item and location IDs from the APWorld</li>
                                        <li>Support for many earlier versions of Minecraft than just the latest version</li>
                                        <li>Support for Fabric, Forge and NeoForge out of the box</li>
                                        <li>Lots of vanilla randomizer features, and a more scalable framework</li>
                                        <li>Support for KubeJS (Fabric/Forge/NeoForge)</li>
                                        <li>Legacy client support for 1.12.2 and under (still being planned)</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>
                                        Newly discussed is a mixin system for the APWorld,
                                        which would exist to add better mod support.
                                        This could theoretically work on top of the vanilla APWorld,
                                        and would offer a better way to express very complicated logic
                                        in modded APWorld implementations.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        We're working to fill in the blanks and document everything officially.
                                        Discussion about the rewrite is going by very quick, and all is going smoothly.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        As I learn more about the Archipelago API,
                                        I will likely be working on this randomizer in tandem with
                                        the Sonic CD randomizer, so I can have a bit of room to fail there too.
                                        This project has more moving parts, after all.

                                        Right now I'm working on extracting and representing
                                        data for a new tradesanity feature.
