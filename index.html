                                <h3>Summary of Projects</h3>
                                <p>
                                        As of right now, I'm working on several Archipelago randomizer projects.
                                        The others are side projects.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        The Minecraft and Sonic CD randomizer projects are very different in most ways,
                                        but similar in others.
                                        They both involve adding client support on top of a scripting language,
                                        the former which I've used much more than the latter.
                                        So my hope is that by completing one project, the other will be easier, and vice
                                        versa.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        The CrossCode randomizer is a different can of worms, since
                                        I mostly work on the data used for generation.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        My other projects are more experimental. I'm interested in developing them
                                        for other reasons. They are not as high priority at the moment.

                                <p>
                                        The idea has been around for a while, and I'm fairly confident that
                                        it'll work pretty well once the tooling exists.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        As of now, there's a lot of Java and JS code to sift through.
                                        If I'm lucky, everything should be pretty doable.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        As I learn more about the Archipelago API,
                                        I will likely be working on this randomizer in tandem with
                                        the Sonic CD randomizer, so I can have a bit of room to fail there too.
                                        This project has more moving parts, after all.
