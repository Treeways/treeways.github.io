                                <h3>Summary of Projects</h3>
                                <p>
                                        As of right now, I'm working on several Archipelago randomizer projects.
                                        The others are side projects.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        The CrossCode randomizer is a different can of worms, since
                                        I mostly work on the data used for generation - however,
                                        it'd be cool to take on more roles once these other randomizers
                                        are in a good state.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        My other projects are more experimental. I'm interested in developing them
                                        for other reasons. They are not as high priority at the moment.
                                </p>

                                <h3>AP Minecraft Multiworld Randomizer</h3>
                                <p>
                                        A full client rewrite is being worked on. It's focused on
                                        modularity, maintainability and flexibility for any kind of modpack.
                                        This will include first-class vanilla support
                                        for the latest version of Minecraft
                                        (possibly including individual mod implementations),
                                        KubeJS support for various versions,
                                        and core client code that is easy enough to port
                                        to beta and legacy versions of Minecraft.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        I'm putting in my all to offer the best I can. If all goes well,
                                        this could bring wide support to modded Minecraft randomization
                                        for the broader community.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        We'll be making the vanilla implementation work for everyone,
                                        from casual players to modded veterans.
                                        We plan to bring full feature parity from the old randomizer to the new one,
                                        and create a very sturdy foundation for adding new features on top of it.
                                </p>
